## Compare two PDF documents using Java

It becomes very difficult to find the difference between what was changed in one of the versions, particularly when working with large-volume PDF documents. The **[GroupDocs.Comparison for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/java)** (which is a part of Conholdate.Total for Java) provides you many choices for comparing a wide range of [supported file formats](https://docs.groupdocs.com/comparison/java/supported-document-formats/), including PDF format.

After the comparison, there are three colors on the resulting file that highlight the differences.

*   Elements that were inserted in the first file. – <font color="blue">**blue**</font>, by default
*   Elements wich were deleted from the first file – <font color="red">**red**</font>, by default
*   Elements that have changed their styles (font, color, etc.) – <font color="green">**green**</font>, by default
