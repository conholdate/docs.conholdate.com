The GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET (which is the part of Conholdate.Total for .NET) allows you to easily extract metadata from PDF, DOC, PPT, XLS and many other files of different types in your .NET solution.

You donâ€™t need to worry about the exact file format and metadata standards it can deal with. The same code will work for all supported formats in the same way.

Tags are most commonly used metadata properties defined in GroupDocs.Metadata that allow searching them across all supported files in various metadata packages. The Tags are divided into categories to make them easy to search a required tag.
